# Cat-goriser-automatiquement-des-questions
This repistory contains the requirement files and folder , which used to carry out this project.In fact this project intend to develop a suggest tag system to the site <font size=3> Stack Overflow </font>. This site is a well known site of question-reply in the informatic field, so to make question in this site we should enter various tags which allow to easy find the question.  
Our goal is to test a supervised and unsupervised approachs , which allow allow to assign automaticaly tags for a question. Then , we carry out a comparison of the results obtained from the two approachs . Besides we develop an API , which allow to assign tags to each introduced question based on the two tested approachs .  
So find in this repistory :  
- The file <font color=black> **QueryResults.csv** which had been extracted from the site<font size=3> Stack Overflow </font> . 
- The file namely <font color=black> **exploration.ipynb**</font> which allow to bring  cleaning operations, and to extract the stastic tf and tf-idf for each text.  
- The file namely <font color=black> **tests.ipynb**</font> which allow test an supervised approach and unsupervised approach based to the method <font color=black> **LDA**</font>. Then we give a coparatif table of two approachs.  
- The file namely <font color=black>**Résumé P6.pdf ** </font>, present the different treatements that we had carried out , differents modelisations that had been used and the obtained results.  
- The file namely <font color=black> **Présentation P6.pdf** </font>, present various slides which had been used to represent the problimatic and the results from the project.  
- The folder <font color=black>**API**</font>, contain all the elemnts that we has used to prepare our API.
